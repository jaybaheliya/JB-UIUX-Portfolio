# JB-UIUX-Portfolio
Hi! My name is Jwala Singh Baheliya also know as Jay (Nickname). I am a Web Developer (UX-UI), and I'm very passionate and dedicated to my work. With 4+ years experience as a professional Web developer, I have acquired the skills and knowledge necessary to make your project a success. I enjoy every step of the design process, from discussion and collaboration to concept and execution, but I find the most satisfaction in seeing the finished product do everything for you that it was created to do.  I have couple of hobbies like to play games on PC , exploring websites , listing calm musics etc. I am fond of PC Games.
